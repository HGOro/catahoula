        <h3>Xoloitzcuintli Facts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>
                        Xoloitzcuintli = xolotl + itzcuintli. 
                    </h4>
                    <em>Xolotl</em> is the Aztec god of life and death. <em>Itzcuintli</em> is nahuatl for "dog."
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>
                        These doggos are most recognizable for having little to no fur.
                    </h4>
                    Whereas many other hairless dogs and cats are a result of humans breeding them, 
                    the Xoloitzcuintli developed with little human intervention.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>
                        The breed's existence can be traced back 3000 years.
                    </h4>
                    As hinted in the previous fact, Xolos are a primitive breed. 
                    Depictions of these intelligent, independent dogs date as far back as pre-Colombian times.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    <h4>
                        With origins rooted in Mexico, their presence and influence has been well documented in the region's culture.
                    </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                In Aztec mythology, Xolos were considered companions to the dead on the journey to the underworld.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Throughout Mexican history, Xolos have inspired many artists - painters, authors, photographers - and have become a national symbol.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Most recently, the Xolo has experienced a world-wide rise in popularity due to a lovable Xolo's role in Disney's <em>Coco</em>.
